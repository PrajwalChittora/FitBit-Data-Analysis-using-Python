# FitBit Data Analysis using Python - Google Analytics Professional Certificate Project

* **Note:** This project follows a structured data analysis methodology. The "Share" and "Act" sections contain the main insights and recommendations.  The earlier sections ("Ask", "Prepare", "Process", "Analyze") document the data cleaning and exploratory steps.
* **Navigation Tip:** If you're primarily interested in the analysis results and actionable insights, you can focus on the "Share" and "Act" sections. The preceding sections outline the data preparation and analysis methodology for those interested in the technical process.

**Project Context**

This case study, completed as part of my Google Analytics Professional Certification, focuses on analyzing FitBit fitness data to support Bellabeat, a wellness technology company specializing in women's health products. 

**Problem Statement**

Bellabeat aims to optimize its marketing strategy by better understanding how consumers use smart devices. As a junior data analyst, my task is to analyze FitBit data, uncover usage trends, and provide marketing recommendations tailored to Bellabeat's target audience.

**Key Questions**

* What are the overarching trends in FitBit device usage?
* How do these trends align with Bellabeat's target customers?
* How can Bellabeat leverage these data-driven insights to enhance its marketing efforts?

**Project Deliverables**

* **Business Overview:** Concise summary of Bellabeat's mission and the purpose of this analysis.
* **Data Description:**  Explanation of the FitBit data sources used (e.g., activity, sleep, calorie tracking).
* **Data Preparation:** Documentation of  cleaning, manipulation, and any necessary transformations.
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Summary of findings, supported by visualizations (e.g., trends in steps, sleep patterns, calorie expenditure).
* **Marketing Insights:**  Actionable recommendations for Bellabeat, specifically addressing how to leverage the identified trends.

**Skills Demonstrated**

* **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, manipulating, and transforming data using pandas.
* **Visualization:**  Creating informative plots (scatter plots, histograms, etc.) using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
* **Statistical Analysis:**  Calculating descriptive statistics, correlations, and potentially employing regression techniques.
* **Problem-Solving:** Translating data patterns into solutions for a specific business challenge.
* **Insight & Communication:**  Extracting meaningful findings and communicating them effectively for a marketing audience.

**Tools & Techniques**

* **Python**
* **pandas** 
* **matplotlib / seaborn**
* **NumPy** 
* **Scikit-learn** (if you used machine learning models)

**Next Steps**

* Explore integrating additional FitBit data (e.g., heart rate, menstrual cycle tracking) for a more holistic analysis.
* Research Bellabeat's existing marketing campaigns to refine recommendations.
* Develop an interactive dashboard to present insights in a user-friendly format.
